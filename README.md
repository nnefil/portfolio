# Filipp Nevedrov - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

Hi, I'm Filipp! I graduated from Saint Petersburg National Research University of Information Technologies, Mechanics and Optics with a degree in Management. My professional journey has taken me through roles in sales at a major e-commerce company, procurement, and teaching. While my experiences might seem diverse, I've found clarity in my ambition: I'm deeply committed to building a career as a Data Analyst. Some might say that diving into a new field at 30 is late, but I see it as a timely pivot ensuring no mid-life crisis :smile: I've always had a fervor for learning and now, more than ever, I'm ready to channel that enthusiasm into my newfound passion

This repository is made to show my skills and way for me to track my progress in Data Analytics
